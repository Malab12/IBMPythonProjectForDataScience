# IBM Python Project For DataScience
In this mini-course I was assuming the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst. In this role I was given a scenario and data to begin my Python project. During this process I performed specific tasks such as extracting data, web scraping, visualizing data, and creating a dashboard. 

# Problem Statement
Individual investors using the forum on the Reddit online community named WallStreetBets, started buying into shares of GameStop, a video and computer-game retailer losing money. The influx of demand caused GameStop shares to soar.  All this produced billions of dollars in losses for hedge funds who had sold the stock short. [ 1] GameStop's share price should fall eventually, so the Hedge funds should hold on to the short positions. As a data scientist working for a hedge fund, I had to extract the profit data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the profit for the hedge fund.
